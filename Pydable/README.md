This is a custom audio book reader. Inspired by the audible platform , this is my python "audible clone". This is a personal version that fits my needs. Written in python(hence the name). This audio book reader allows you to define words on the fly by using web scraping techniques. Any pdf file can be converted into a Pydable book.
